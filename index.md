I enjoy playing soccer with my friends and on my own. Not only that, I play for a club soccer team named Force FC. It's a popular competitive soccer club around the area in 4s Ranch. My Favorite team is Arsenal. Every weekend there are Premier League games, which are games from a league in the UK. I usually watch Arsenal games and analyze the same players that play my position.
