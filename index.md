    I enjoy playing soccer with my friends and on my own. Not only that, I play for a club soccer team named Force FC. It's a popular competitive soccer club around the area in 4s Ranch. My Favorite team is Arsenal. Every weekend there are Premier League games, which are games from a league in the UK. I usually watch Arsenal games and analyze the same players that play my position. 
2. Music
    Secondly, one of my favorite things to do is to listen to music. Some of my favorite artists include Drake, J cole, Travis Scott, and 21 Savage.

3. TV and Games
    Lastly, I enjoy playing video games and watching television. Recently, I have started to play the game Fortnite again with some of my friends. It is a 3rd person shoooter game placed in a battle royale-type world where you are tasked with being the last one standing out of 100 players.
